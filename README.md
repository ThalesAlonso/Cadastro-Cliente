<h2>Use</h2>
<h2> Getting Started</h2>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>You'll need to have Node on your machine. We recommend to use Node >= 6 and npm >= 3 for faster installation speed and better disk usage. (you can use yarn too).</p>
<p>It is necessary to have Node.js installed, because a Js lib is used to validate the CPF</p>
<p><strong>npm install gerador-validador-cpf --save</strong></p>
<p>Include the file in the footer of your page, as in the example.<p/>
<p><script src="node_modules/gerador-validador-cpf/dist/js/CPF.js"></script></p>
<p>Apache2 + PHP 7.2 or highe</p>
<p>If I have Python installed on the machine, I suggest uploading a server to view in realtime
 the code.
command to upload the server <strong>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9001</strong>
</p>
